# Infix-to-posfix-In-java
hello world! i am using simple stack data structure to do this problem

In this code you are only use the operands like("+","-","*","/","^)
and barckets like ("{","(","]")
In this program you are going to ask how many test cases you want to run->>>like 1,2,3 so on as your wish
And then you enter the testcases as you want and imidiately you get your answers....

I think almost all testcase are runing in this code 
if any exception occurs then you are always welcome to edit the code.

Then
send me the fork request
i will verify your account then i accept it.and it takes some time to reply you

Thank youðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
